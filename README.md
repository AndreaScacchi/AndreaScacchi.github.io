### *ROME*

## About the wbsite
This website is intended to be used as an overview of Rome(its history), where you can explore many different places.
Find out more about the *Eternal City*, enjoy many images used to improve the user experience, and explore places, monuments, ancient ruins, etc.
It's a responsive website, so you can visit it directly on your smartphone or tablet, as well as on your PC.

## Features of the website
Like I said it is responsive, so this project is accessible throughout any device, and its main feature is that it include different animations
to render it more pleasant. Moreover, it also includes a section where you can easily convert currency to find out how much money you need to stay in *Rome*, Italy. Last but not least, in the *gallery* section, there are images automatically loaded to give you a better understanding of how much Rome is amazing.

## Technologies used
This website is based mainly on *HTML*, *CSS* and *JavaScript*. However, there are several different technologies I used to make it more user friendly and more pleasant.
- *[AOS](https://michalsnik.github.io/aos/)*: library to implement the animations on several sections.
- *Anime*: library to implement the animations on text used thanks to [Tobias Ahlin](https://tobiasahlin.com/moving-letters/).
